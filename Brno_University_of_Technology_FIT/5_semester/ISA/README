=========== 
Implementation of a POP3 Server standardized by RFC 1939 Internet standard.
This tool named 'popser' was created as a project for a Network Applications 
and Network Administration 2017 class.

Description
===========
Popser operates as a POP3 server. It enables clients to connect to it and download 
data via POP3 protocol. The tool works with e-mails in an IMF format in a Maildir 
format structure. The Maildir manipulates only 1 mailbox for 1 user. Popser utilizes
a non-blocking parallel TCP socket, thus concurrently handles multiple client 
communication. Authentication of users is required, as well as an unique access 
to the maildrop ensured by a mutex lock. Once the user is given access to it,
new e-mails are downloaded. Next manipulation such as listing, deleting or retrieving
e-mails follow. Afterwards, the client ends the communication and the connection is
terminated.


Installation
============
Execution of the tool is possible right after the provided Makefile is run. The 
executable file name is 'popser'. Any further manipulation within the executable 
binary file's directory is highly discouraged as it may disrupt the functionality
of the program.

make 		runs the script and outputs an executable binary file 'popser'
make clean	cleans files created by the make execution


Usage example
=============
Popser usage: ./popser [-h] [-a PATH] [-c] [-p PORT] [-d PATH] [-r]
	[-h|--help] Prints help (this message) and exit
	[-a] Path to the authentication file
	[-c] Accepts non-encrypted login password method (optional parameter)
	[-p] Runs application on this port
	[-d] Path to the Maildir folder
	[-r] Resets the Maildir (optional parameter)

Examples:
./popser -h
./popser -a ~/popser_authentication -p 13378 -d ~/Maildir/ -r
./popser -a ~/popser_authentication -c -p 13378 -d ~/Maildir/

Clients can then connect via Telnet on the given port.


Limitations
===========
The program fully implements the RFC 1939 specification apart from the section 8,
does not support encryption (TSL/SSL) and omits the 'TOP' command.
